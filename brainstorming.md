2. In order to validate the data provided, we need to check that it is a number, and that it has a time. For the first goal, we make sure that the data is a number or if the data provided has a celcius sign we only take the number protion of it. For the second goal, we check that the data has a timestamp, if there is no timestamp then we return the current timestamp. In the case of dealing with invalid data, we basically retrun a invlaid data console.log and then discrd the data. We make sure that the invalid data dosent reach the frontend at any point to prevent any further malfucntions in the display.
